Matrix33f / Matrix44f are credited to Chris McCooey, and are utilized with his permision.
While these classes are being utilized for the demo, I have implemented a full NxN Matrix class.
Unfortunately, due to time limitations, I was unable to resolve a bug regarding loss of data within the Matrix class, but the functions are all implemented and mostly work.
This will be discussed further within a blog post, but Chris assisted in allowing me to fix the Matrix problems and focus on collision resolution.
